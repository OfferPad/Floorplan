We do all the paperwork, we pay closing and title fees&sup1;, you pick your own close date, if you need to stay in your home a few days past close&sup2; you can, we provide dedicated support throughout the entire process and we’ll even move you for free*.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>Unlike traditional real estate which has not changed in decades, you don’t have to list your home, repair or upgrade it, keep it clean, show it to strangers and then negotiate a closing date. We provide a better experience.</p>

                    <p>We're different from flippers who offer to buy your home directly&mdash;at the lowest price they can&mdash;because we make our money by efficiently renovating and selling your home. We don’t try to deprive you of the value you have built up in your largest investment.</p>

                    <p>OfferPad was amazing from the very beginning. Step-by-step with every one of my questions they had quick and professional answers. As we closed today, we still can't believe what a simple and painless process this has been. Real Estate home selling has changed forever.</p>
